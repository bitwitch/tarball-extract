## Tarball Extract

**Building:**  
Windows only, but the only platform specific code is creating a directory. Should be easy to port.  
On windows, make sure you have access to the msvc compiler in a command prompt, then from the project root run:  
`$ build`  

**Example:**
To extract the included example run:  
`$ build\tarball_extract.exe test-dir.tar.gz`
